# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## Version 0.9.0 - 2025-03-17

- Moves macro targets into this project. No longer depending on separate https://github.com/stadiamaps/maplibre-swift-macros repo.

## Version 0.8.0 - 2025-03-17

- onMapViewProxyUpdate can now be set up to update in realtime or when animations/scrolling complete (default).

## Version 0.7.0 - 2025-02-02

### Added

- Adds support for a `belowSymbols` layer order. The `renderBelowSymbols` modifier on layers will insert the new layer below the first symbol layer in the style. This allows for rendering below labels and icons.
- BREAKING: Refactored the layer position modifiers to accept enum variants to enable better extensibility.

### Fixed

- Moved modifiers on `StyleLayer` to `StyleLayerDefinition`. The previous extension of `StyleLayer` was a mistake, since `StyleLayerDefinition` is the supertype, and none of the behavior was specific to `StyleLayer`.

## Version 0.6.0 - 2025-01-14

- Potentially BREAKING: Upgrades Mockable to 0.2.0. If you're using mockable in your project, this may require you to upgrade there as well.

## Version 0.5.0 - 2025-01-09

### Added

- BREAKING: Rename `MapViewPort` to `MapViewProxy`. This will be an extension point for safe read operations that can be proxied to the underlying map view without exposing it directly (ex: via the unsafe modifiers).
- Added FillStyleLayer and example.

## Version 0.4.2 - 2024-12-03

### Fixed

- Fixes a race modifying state during view update in rare cases

## Version 0.4.1 - 2024-11-19

### Fixed

- Fixes failed builds when this packages is integrated in an App. InternalUtils package was missing a dependency to MapLibre

## Version 0.4.0 - 2024-11-19

### Changed

This release upgrades MapLibre Native to version 6.8.1. 

## Version 0.3.2 - 2024-11-11

### Fixed

- Reverts changes in 0.3.1; they were ultimately unnecessary and introduced a new bug, stopping location updates.

## Version 0.3.1 - 2024-10-17

### Fixed

- Fixed the location manager being nil after SwiftUI view update.

## Version 0.3.0 - 2024-10-14

### Changed

This release upgrades Swift tooling for Swift 5.10.

## Version 0.2.0 - 2024-10-07

### Added

- `MLNMapViewCameraUpdating.setUserTrackingMode(_ mode: MLNUserTrackingMode, animated: Bool, completionHandler: (() -> Void)?)`
  in [#53](https://github.com/maplibre/swiftui-dsl/pull/53).
  Previously, you could only call `mapViewCameraUpdating.userTrackingMode = newMode`
  without specifying `animated` or `completionHandler`.

### Fixed

- Fix broken animation when setting user tracking mode in [#53](https://github.com/maplibre/swiftui-dsl/pull/53).
  For example, when tapping the "recenter" button in Ferrostar (which uses this
  package), the map now immediately re-centers on the users current location,
  whereas before you'd have to tap it twice. Note: the bug wasn't noticeable
  when using the Ferrostar's SimulatedLocationProvider.
- Pitch range `.free` was being reset to `.freeWithinRange(0, 59.9999999)`
  Fixed in in [#54](https://github.com/maplibre/swiftui-dsl/pull/54).

## Version 0.1.0 - 2024-09-21

This project has migrated from Stadia Maps to the MapLibre organization!
To celebrate, we're bumping the version and adding a CHANGELOG.

Xcode and GitHub normally handle these sorts of changes well,
but sometimes they don't.
So, you'll probably want to be proactive and change your URLs from
`https://github.com/stadiamaps/maplibre-swiftui-dsl-playground`
to `https://github.com/maplibre/swiftui-dsl`.

If you're building a plain Xcode project, it might actually be easier to remove the Swift Package
and all of its targets and then re-add with the URL.

Swift Package authors can simply update the URLs.
Note that the package name also changes with the repo name.

```swift
    .product(name: "MapLibreSwiftDSL", package: "swiftui-dsl"),
    .product(name: "MapLibreSwiftUI", package: "swiftui-dsl"),
```
